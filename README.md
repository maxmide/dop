# Doctrine of PanAfricanism

In thi document, it is made clear that PanAfricanism is a cultural, economic, and political idea
that calls for every African to join forces and create an economic and political system that will
benefit every African on the contient. Africa is a diverse continent in many ways. Our differences
have been used against us for so long. PanAfricanism is way for Africans to recognize their 
differences and use them for their unity. A new Africa is onl possible when we get together.
As Africans, our fate is not our own. We only have control on very issues that affect our lives.
We have an abundance of resources and land, but we rarely reap the full benefits of these
resources.

PanAfricanism is not about our skin color, it is not about religion, and it is not about our
ethnicities. PanAfricanism is a way for Africans to combine their resources and create
an economy in services for Africans.
